     <h2>REACTNATIVE IS ONE OF THE EASIEST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES EVER </h2>
         
     <u>Introduction</u><br>
     React is the tool of choice for many web developers who build front-end web interfaces. Dubbed as the premium way to build rich experiences on the browser, many front-end developers have come to embrace it. In spite of its popularity, React has many well-kept secrets newcomers might not know and seasoned veterans may not have yet realized.
     <br>
     The React tool itself is rather small, yet a vibrant community has sprung up around it. For example, in the React ecosystem, you will find React Router and the Flux architecture. Additional tools can often generate a lot of commotion which can make you lose focus. This somewhat obscures the hidden gems one can find while programming in React.
     <br>
     For web developers, the recent explosion of front-end frameworks is moving at a neck-breaking speed. At times, it may feel overwhelming to learn everything there is to know about any one choice. Teams tend to pick what is more popular in the JavaScript community which further discourages the need to go beneath the surface.
     <br>
     
 <br>
<u> Not a Framework</u><br>
One common misconception is that React is a front-end framework. This stems from the Hollywood principle: “don’t call us, we’ll call you.” On the surface, it does seem like React calls the render() method for you and does a bunch of magic behind the scenes. This can be scary for newcomers because frameworks can hijack the page while making incomprehensible mind-warping changes to the DOM.
<br>
Supports Type Systems
React comes with a built-in way to validate props, these are called propTypes. React components can be part of a hierarchy of bigger components, therefore, a good practice is to validate prop data types. Think of propTypes as building a strongly-typed system inside each component. This type system adds clarity and intent to React components.

To declare a propType validator, let’s say you have a component MyReactComponent. This React component has a required prop named myComponentProperty of type string.
<br>
React is part of the latter, meaning that it is a library and not a framework. You can think of every component as an abstraction that wraps around the DOM. React calls this abstraction the virtual DOM and lets you write components in plain JavaScript. In React, you may bypass the virtual DOM and make direct changes to the DOM if you need to.
<br>
The virtual DOM in React calculates the minimal amount of changes necessary to sync up with the DOM. This increases the performance of your web interfaces because the library respects the DOM. The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation which makes it faster and more efficient than the real DOM. React reconciles the current state of the UI with the virtual DOM and calculates the set of changes to do this. This means React components can run at 60fps, even on low-powered mobile devices.
<br>
You can think of the virtual DOM as a React component. This layer of abstraction is a self-contained and a single concern building block. This component can be written in plain JavaScript which gives you, the programmer, complete control over the UI. The library gets out of the way and gives you total freedom while calculating minutiae like DOM changes for you.

<u>Supports Type Systems<br></u>
React comes with a built-in way to validate props, these are called propTypes. React components can be part of a hierarchy of bigger components, therefore, a good practice is to validate prop data types. Think of propTypes as building a strongly-typed system inside each component. This type system adds clarity and intent to React components.

To declare a propType validator, let’s say you have a component MyReactComponent. This React component has a required prop named myComponentProperty of type string.
      <br>
      
<u>For example:<br></u>
<mark>
MyReactComponent.propTypes = {
  <br>
  myComponentProperty: PropTypes.string.isRequired<br>
};</mark>
<br><br>
By declaring propTypes, it is easy for any programmer that looks at the code to understand its intent. These validators will throw errors that show up in the console when you pass in the wrong type.
<br><br><br>
React supports many propType validators which enhance the type system. Keep in mind you can chain isRequired to ensure a warning is shown when the prop goes missing.
<br><br><br>
Here is the complete list of prop-types:
<br><br>
.PropTypes.array: prop must be an array<br>
.PropTypes.bool: prop must be a boolean<br>
.PropTypes.bool: prop must be a boolean<br>
.PropTypes.func: prop must be a function<br>
.PropTypes.number: prop must be a number<br>
.PropTypes.object: prop must be an object<br>
.PropTypes.symbol: prop must be a symbol<br>
<div class=""></div>PropTypes.string: prop must be a string<br><br><br>
PropTypes match the primitive type system inside JavaScript. Think of propTypes as a superset of the primitive type system that now validates the type you pass into the component.<br><br>
       <br>
       <u> React has a strong community</u><br><br>
       Developers love React, and it shows in how strong the community around it is. React’s official website lists multiple thriving React communities, each with thousands of users who are happy to share their experience, give useful tips, and answer code-level questions.
       <br><br>
       There’s also a massive amount of free or extremely affordable React resources on sites like YouTube, Udemy, Coursera, and others. To get a good overview of what’s available, we highly recommend this list of resources to learn React.
       <br><br>
       Because React is based on JavaScript, one of the most approachable programming languages in the world, you can be sure that the community around it is nothing but friendly and welcoming. With no elitism to spoil the mood, React beginners are not afraid to ask questions, which is exactly how it should be.
   <br><br>
   <u> React is not just a fad</u><br><br>
At this point in time, the enterprise adoption of React is so high that it’s possible to say with confidence that React is not just a fad. From Facebook to Netflix to Khan Academy, there are thousands of high-profile companies that have successfully adopted React and used it to create massively successful digital products.
<br><br>
React has been around for just a couple of years, and it’s guaranteed that it’s not going away anytime soon. Of course, it will one day most likely be replaced by something even better, but that’s just how technology evolves over time.
