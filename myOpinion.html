My Thoughts
<br><br>
Personally, I love React, or at least, I love the whole idea of small, composable components inside of JavaScript. 
It makes writing dynamic applications a lot interesting  than using something like simple JavaScript
<br><br>
 <u>As per my knowledge</u><br>
 ReactJS and React Native are the new technologies for web and mobile development introduced by Facebook.<br>
  The project was started by Jordan Walke, a Facebook software engineer, in 2011. To simplify the development process and foster a more comfortable user experience, he decided to create a library that would allow for building a web interface with JavaScript.

  <br>
  The concepts of react are initially confusing but when u start spending time with it<br> u gradually understand it and are able to 
  implement the concepts,the concepts are depended on <u>logical understanding</u>
